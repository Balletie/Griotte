I represent a user which can do operations in a review.

I am useful for identifying and distinguishing between different users, by means of an avatar and a username. Furthermore, I can be asked which repositories I own.

Public API and Key Messages

- avatar: the avatar of this user. By default it is a question mark icon.
- username: the username, by default 'Anonymous'.
- allRepositories answers all of the repositories I own, not necessarily just local repositories.
